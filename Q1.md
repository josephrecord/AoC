# Day 1: Inverse Captcha

## Part 1

We are given a series of digits in a text file and asked to find "the sum all of all digits that match the next digit in the list". The list is circular so the first digit is also the digit that occurs after the last digit. Here are the examples given in the question:
- 1122 produces a sum of 3 (1 + 2) because the first digit (1) matches the second digit and the third digit (2) matches the fourth digit.
- 1111 produces 4 because each digit (all 1) matches the next.
- 1234 produces 0 because no digit matches the next.
- 91212129 produces 9 because the only digit that matches the next one is the last digit, 9.

###### Solution

Once I comprehended the question, specifically, what "the sum all of all digits that match the next digit in the list" meant, I came up with a pretty quick solution. (Isn't this always the main problem of programming?) Admittedly, it took me a while to really grasp the question. My naive solution looked something like this:


```python
# open the text file containing the "captcha"
with open("C:\\Users\\jrecord\\Documents\\AoC_2017_1.txt") as f:
    l = f.readline()
```


```python
# the captcha is read as a string, so convert to an int
n = int(l)
# now let's take the int and create a list of ints, each element of the list being a digit
num = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
```


```python
# create a variable called sum which stores our answer
sum = 0
# for each element, compare the value to the next element's value, if they are equal then they match and we can add the value of that element to the sum
for i in range(len(num)-1):
    if num[i] == num[i+1]:
        sum = sum + num[i]
```

Boom. That's all. Right? Not quite. This answer doesn't consider the case where the last digit matches the first digit. In that case our sum would be num(length) less than the correct answer. Of course, in the given data this "edge case" (it isn't really an edge case is it?) occurs. Let's add a quick and dirty test case: 


```python
if num[0] == num[len(num)-1]:
    sum = sum + num[0]
```


```python
print(sum)
```

## Part 2

Did I mention there's a part 2? There's always a part 2.

Part 2 is described as such:
>Now, instead of considering the next digit, it wants you to consider the digit halfway around the circular list. That is, if your list contains 10 items, only include a digit in your sum if the digit 10/2 = 5 steps forward matches it. Fortunately, your list has an even number of elements.

I spent some time here trying to tweak my method for part 1 to work with part 2. My initial solution isn't very flexible here because once I get halfway through the digits I would run into index problems because my list isn't circular. I looked into using itertools.cycle to create a circular list which could be stepped through a given number of times. This was better but still not elegant enough. If I do something like  



```python
circular = cycle(num)
```

I would have to call


```python
next(circular)
```

a given number of times to reach the digit halfway around the list. In doing so I would lose my place in the circular list and therefore this would require some sort of indexing or pointer to remember my place in the list. I decided to give up on this and focus on the algorithm to see if there was a simpler solution. What if we create another list of digits that is "rotated" by a given number such that when we call


```python
rotate((1, 2, 3, 4), 1)
```

we get (2, 3, 4, 1)? For index i, i+1, i+2, etc., we can compare the values to one another and check for equality. This is nice because instead of rotating just once to get the next element, we can also rotate len(num)//2 times to go halfway around the list, giving us a solution that works for both part 1 and 2. Here's the final solution:


```python
def rotate(l, n):
    return l[n:] + l[:n]

with open("C:\\Users\\jrecord\\Documents\\AoC_2017_1.txt") as f:
    l = f.readline()

n = int(l)
num = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
length = len(num)

num_rot1 = rotate(num,1)
num_rot2 = rotate(num,length//2)

sum1 = 0
sum2 = 0

for i in range(length):
    if num[i] == num_rot1[i]:
        sum1 = sum1 + num[i]

for i in range(length):
    if num[i] == num_rot2[i]:
        sum2 = sum2 + num[i]

print("The answer to part 1 is {}".format(sum1))
print("The answer to part 2 is {}".format(sum2))

```

    The answer to part 1 is 1228
    The answer to part 2 is 1238
    

Two stars for day 1. Let's see if we can keep it going for day 2!
